# TERAFFI Business and Revenue Model

## Primary Business Model: Transaction Fee (Revenue Sharing)

TERAFFI operates on a **transaction fee model** where the platform takes a percentage of each successful partnership deal facilitated through the network. This model aligns TERAFFI's success directly with member success, creating a scalable revenue stream that grows with the platform.

### 1. Contractual Agreements
