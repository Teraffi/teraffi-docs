# Task: Signal Processing & Filtering Pipeline (5-6 hours)
**ADR:** ADR-016  
**Date:** 2025-10-01

## Inputs
- Raw social signals from collectors
- Filtering rules
- Quality thresholds

## Outputs
- Signal processor
- Noise filtering
- Quality scoring
- Batch aggregation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter spam and low-quality signals
- [ ] Remove duplicate signals
- [ ] Calculate quality score (engagement, source credibility)
- [ ] Aggregate signals by time window (hourly)
- [ ] Store filtered signals in database
- [ ] Processing latency <30 seconds
- [ ] Unit tests with noisy data

## Implementation Details
Implement filtering rules: minimum engagement thresholds, spam detection, duplicate removal. Calculate quality score based on engagement and source. Aggregate into hourly batches for trend extraction.
