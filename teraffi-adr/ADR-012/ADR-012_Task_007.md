# Task: Cost Monitoring & Optimization (3-4 hours)
**ADR:** ADR-012  
**Date:** 2025-10-01

## Inputs
- OpenAI API usage
- Pinecone metrics
- Application metrics

## Outputs
- Cost tracking dashboards
- Budget alerts
- Optimization recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Track OpenAI embedding API calls and costs
- [ ] Track Pinecone read/write units
- [ ] Daily/monthly cost projections
- [ ] Alert if costs exceed $X threshold
- [ ] Cache hit ratio monitoring
- [ ] Recommendations for cost reduction

## Implementation Details
Instrument embedding generation and Pinecone queries. Calculate costs based on API usage. Create Grafana dashboard showing costs over time. Set up alerts for budget thresholds.
