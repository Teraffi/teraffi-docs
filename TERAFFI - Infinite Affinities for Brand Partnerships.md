# TERAFFI - Infinite Affinities for Brand

# Partnerships

User stories and revolutionary business model that aligns with Jobs to Be Done (JTBD).

## User Story: Product Manager Perspective

##### User: Content Producer (e.g., Independent Film Studio)

##### Job to Be Done (JTBD):

##### *"I need to secure brand partnerships to fund my film ’s $2M production budget and

##### amplify its reach through authentic audience connections. I want Teraffi to:

##### 1. Identify brands that share affinities with my film ’s themes (e.g., sustainability,

##### adventure travel, Gen Z activism).

##### 2. Generate customized partnership proposals for each brand (e.g., product

##### placements, co-branded campaigns).

##### 3. Ensure brands meet my criteria (budget ≥ $100k, distribution by Q3 2025,

##### audience alignment).

##### 4. Negotiate and close deals without manual back-and-forth.

## Teraffi’s JTBD Revenue Model

Companies have become resistant to SaaS, seat-based models.

## 1. JTBD Opportunities

##### For Content Producers/IP Holders:

##### ● Monetization Matchmaking: Charge per successful partnership deal (e.g., 5–15%

##### of deal value).

##### ● Proposal Generation: Fee for AI-curated, brand-specific pitches (e.g., $500–$2k

##### per proposal).

##### ● Campaign Activation: Revenue share from executing co-branded campaigns (e.g.,

##### 20% of activation spend).

##### For Brands:

##### ● Affinity-Driven Targeting: Subscription fee for access to pre-vetted,

##### affinity-aligned IP opportunities.


##### ● Outcome-Based Pricing: Pay only when KPIs are met (e.g., $X per 1,000 engaged

##### viewers).

##### ● Risk Mitigation: Premium fee for guaranteed performance (e.g., clawbacks if

##### audience targets aren’t hit).

##### For Both:

##### ● Data Licensing: Sell affinity insights (e.g., $10k/month for access to cultural trend

##### reports).

##### ● Web3 Add-Ons: Tokenized revenue-sharing agreements (e.g., 2% fee on NFT

##### co-branded drops).

## Why This Model is Revolutionary

##### 1. Outcome-Aligned Pricing:

##### ● Clients pay only when Teraffi delivers value (e.g., closed deals, engaged

##### audiences).

##### ● Eliminates SaaS’s “empty seat” problem—no unused licenses or wasted

##### spend.

##### 2. Self-Reinforcing Ecosystem:

##### ● Network Effect: More IP holders → More brands → Better AI matches →

##### More revenue.

##### ● Data Moats: Proprietary affinity graphs improve with every deal, making

##### Teraffi’ s matches irreplaceable.

##### 3. Defensible Workflows:

##### ● AI + Human “Activator” Workforce: Teraffi combines AI-driven insights with

##### human expertise to negotiate deals and activate campaigns, creating a

##### hybrid moat.

##### ● Cultural Relevance Engine: Real-time analysis of Reddit, fan communities,

##### and IRL trends ensures Teraffi stays ahead of competitors relying on stale

##### CRM data.

##### 4. Cross-Industry Disruption:

##### ● Advertising: Replace CPMs with performance-based fees.

##### CRM: Shift from tracking interactions to driving revenue-generating

##### partnerships.

##### Entertainment Finance: Monetize IP earlier by connecting creators directly

##### to brands.

## Example Workflow

##### 1. Content Producer Submits Film Project:

##### ● Teraffi’ s AI scans the script for themes (e.g., “sustainable fashion”),

##### analyzes the target audience (e.g., eco-conscious Gen Z), and identifies

##### endemic distribution channels (e.g., Patagonia’s DTC app, REI’s YouTube).

##### 2. Brand Matching:


##### ● AI matches the film to 50 brands with shared affinities (e.g., Allbirds,

##### Patagonia, REI).

##### ● Generates 50 customized proposals (language, visuals, KPIs tailored to

##### each brand).

##### 3. Deal Execution:

##### ● Teraffi’ s Activators negotiate terms, using AI playbooks to counter

##### objections.

##### ● Brands pay Teraffi a 10% fee on closed deals (e.g., $100k from a $1M

##### partnership).

##### 4. Campaign Activation:

##### ● Teraffi’ s workforce executes a co-branded TikTok challenge

##### (#SustainableAdventure) targeting fans of the film and the brand.

##### ● Charges 15% of the $200k activation budget.

##### 5. Ongoing Monetization:

##### ● Licenses affinity data to brands for future campaigns ($10k/month).

##### ● Launches NFT collectibles tied to the film, earning 2% on secondary sales.

## Moat Analysis

##### ● Complexity Advantage: Competitors lack the AI + human hybrid model to scale

##### customized proposals.

##### ● Switching Costs: Brands/IP holders become reliant on Teraffi’ s ecosystem for

##### revenue.

##### ● Cultural Agility: Real-time affinity mapping keeps Teraffi indispensable in

##### fast-moving markets.

##### This model transforms Teraffi from a software vendor into a mission-critical revenue

##### partner for brands and creators—a defensible, category-defining position.

```
#### 1B. High-Level User Flows

**User Story #1: Content Producer – “Automate My Brand Partnership Outreach”**

1. As a Content Producer, I want to:
    ○ Upload a one-sheet, synopsis, or script data describing my content (genre, cast,
       storyline, budget, timeline).
    ○ Input relevant distribution channels (e.g., Netflix, theatrical, major networks,
       digital streaming platforms).
    ○ Specify brand categories I’m open to partnering with (e.g., automotive, fashion,
       tech) and constraints (e.g., no alcohol for a children’s show).
    ○ Define my monetization goals and target audience metrics (e.g., $500K in brand
       integrations, brand tie-ins that reach Gen Z).
    ○ Receive recommended brand partnerships from the Teraffi Affinity Engine.
2. Teraffi’s “Affinity Engine” automatically:
    ○ Parses the content details (script or metadata).
    ○ Finds key themes (e.g., “environmental sustainability,” “motorsport,” “urban family
       drama”).


```
○ Weighs these themes against known brand affinities (e.g., brand’s mission,
brand’s customer demographics, brand’s product categories).
○ Presents a curated list of potential brand matches sorted by highest affinity score.
```
3. As a Content Producer, I then:
    ○ Review automated “pitch decks” Teraffi generates for each prospective brand
       (tailored messaging, color palette, brand’s marketing style).
    ○ Select which brand prospects to approach, or let Teraffi’s auto-outreach do it on
       my behalf.
4. **Outcome (JTBD)** :
    ○ A pipeline of brand deals that fund or sponsor my project, with minimal manual
       deck-building and brand research.
**User Story #2: Brand Stakeholder – “Find High-Affinity Content to Sponsor”**
1. As a Brand Manager, I want to:
○ Create a brand profile outlining brand identity, key products, marketing
objectives, target demographics, brand messaging and guidelines (color palette,
tone, brand values).
○ Specify campaign objectives (e.g., “Reach urban millennials interested in
sustainable living,” budget $500k, must execute in Q4).
○ Subscribe to relevant categories of content (e.g., action sports, comedic drama,
documentaries on sustainability).
2. Teraffi’s “Affinity Engine” automatically:
○ Scores existing content projects against brand’s stated objectives and brand’s
historical partnership success data.
○ Recommends only the top X% of relevant content opportunities with an estimate
of audience alignment (affinity scoring).
3. As a Brand Stakeholder, I can:


```
○ Review recommended content, see “affinity reasons” (e.g., synergy around “solar
tech,” alignment with brand values).
○ Opt into direct communication or let Teraffi generate an “interest notice” to the
Content Producer.
○ Negotiate partnership terms within Teraffi’s integrated deal-flow system (potential
inclusion of influencer marketing, IP usage rights, co-branded campaigns).
```
4. **Outcome (JTBD)** :
    ○ Efficiently discover and lock in top-tier partnerships that truly resonate with our
       brand’s audience, without sifting through irrelevant pitches.
**User Story #3: Ongoing Campaign & Relationship Management**
1. As a Content Producer or Brand Stakeholder, I want to:
○ Track the status of my deals (in discussion, in contract, in activation).
○ See an automated “moving timeline” that updates as production dates shift,
ensuring everyone is informed of changes.
○ Exchange updated scripts, brand guidelines, creative briefs in a standardized
format within the platform (no more messy email attachments).
2. Teraffi’s system:
○ Alerts participants about updated data points (filming schedule changes, brand
feedback).
○ Suggests potential “activation expansions” (e.g., influencer co-promotions,
additional brands with complementary involvement).
○ Automates compliance checks (e.g., brand usage rights, usage deadlines,
disclaimers, etc.).
3. **Outcome (JTBD)** :
○ A frictionless ongoing management of brand-content partnerships that updates
automatically with minimal manual overhead.


## 2. PRICING & REVENUE MODEL: “JTBD” OVER

## SEAT-BASED

#### 2A. Traditional (Seat-Based) vs. JTBD Approach

```
● Traditional Model : A SaaS subscription with per-user/month fees, or pay per seat.
○ Problem: People don’t want to pay for each seat; brand managers, producers,
and their extended teams might only dip in occasionally, or in certain phases.
● JTBD Model : Pay when an actual “job” is completed and value is created.
○ Jobs (examples):
```
1. **A successful brand partnership match** (Brand “A” invests $X in
    Content Producer’s project).
2. **A completed campaign activation** (Brand invests in co-marketing,
    Teraffi’s system generates X leads, Y sales).
3. **Licensing Teraffi’s affinity data** to build custom campaigns across
    multiple channels.
**Core Mechanics** :
1. **Match Fee** : Teraffi charges a percentage (5-10%) of the actual deal size between brand
and content.
2. **Activation / Success Fee** : Once a campaign is launched, Teraffi might charge a
performance-based fee (e.g., cost-per-action, cost-per-view, cost-per-integration).
3. **Premium “Affinity Engine” Access** : For power users who want advanced analytics or
to integrate Teraffi data with their internal CRM or data lake, Teraffi charges usage-based
or outcome-based fees.
**Why This Scales** :
● Low friction entry: There’s no upfront seat license cost.


● **Network Effects** : The more deals Teraffi facilitates, the deeper its data becomes,
strengthening the “Affinity Engine” models.
● **Moat** : As Teraffi grows, its best-in-class matching AI becomes the “go-to” resource—no
one else has that depth of brand-to-content & brand-to-brand partnership data. We
become an industry standard. Currently, there is no way for a brand to reflect their
“affinity”, it doesn’t exist, much like we didn’t have a LinkedIn profile and way to promote
ourselves before the LinkedIn platform.


## INVESTOR DECK OUTLINE (REVISED)

#### Slide 1:

### ● Title

```
● Teraffi – “Billions of Data Points. Infinite Affinities. AI-matches that Unleash
Unstoppable Partnerships.”
```
### ● (below is our vision statement)

● Teraffi transforms how brands and IP owners discover, create, and scale partnerships
through an AI-driven, jobs-to-be-done model.
●
● 90% of companies’ value is driven by intangible assets.
**Teraffi is the catalyst that supercharges brand value with cost-effective, massively scaled
IP partnerships. Let’s Teraffi.
SLIDE 1 ALTERNATIVE:
Headline:
Teraffi
“Billions of Data Points. Infinite Affinities. AI-Matched Partnerships Accelerate Growth
Possibilities.”
Vision Statement (not to be written out):
Teraffi transforms how brands and IP owners discover, create, and scale
partnerships—through an AI-driven, jobs-to-be-done model built for speed, scale, and
cultural impact.
Why Now:
90% of today’s enterprise value is driven by intangible assets, but advertising is an
ineffective growth strategy.
Teraffi is the catalyst that unlocks and accelerates this hidden value—by powering
high-affinity, high-impact partnerships at scale.**


#### Slide 2: The Problem

1. **Ineffective Advertising & Changing Consumer Behavior**
    ○ Audiences skip ads, subscribe to ad-free streaming, or block ads. Traditional ad
       spending isn’t yielding deep audience connections.
2. **High Cost & Inefficiency**
    ○ 65% of marketing budgets go to activate audiences - sponsorships, experiential,
       activations, and co-branded campaigns – typically arranged via manual, siloed,
       slow processes.
3. **Fragmented Processes in Brand Partnerships**
    ○ No standardized method for brand or IP owners to find each other, pitch deals,
       and track results.
4. **Untapped Value**
    ○ 90% of S&P 500 companies’ value is in intangible assets—brand synergy
       remains an overlooked growth lever.

#### Slide 3: Market Opportunity

```
● Marketing & Activation : ~$1.2T of the total $1.9T ad/marketing spend globally is on
sponsorship, partnerships, and activations.
● “Amazon Books” Beachhead : Starting in Media & Entertainment (film, TV, streaming,
digital creators). Our team has several global automation firsts in the Media &
Entertainment industry.
● Expansion & APIs :
```
1. **Sports** : Team, athletes,, stadium, eSports partnerships.
2. **Social Impact & Philanthropy** : Nonprofit causes, CSR collaborations,
    fundraising campaigns, corporate alliances.


3. **Real Estate** : New Development partnerships and sponsorships, local
    government or tourism tie-ins.
4. **Live Events & Conferences** : Music festivals, trade expos, industry conventions
    seeking brand partners.
5. **Politics & Government** : Campaigns, issue advocacy, bridging partnerships for
    policy initiatives.
6. **M&A:** Proprietary due diligence reports validate partnerships, goodwill, media
    assets, and more.
7. **Gaming:** Brand partnerships and unique audience engagements enrich gamer
    experiences.
Each vertical represents enormous “intangible synergy” potential. Teraffi’s Affinity Engine can
map them all.

#### Slide 4: The Teraffi Solution – “Affinity Engine”

1. **AI Data Ingestion**
    ○ **Avoiding Cold Start** : We don’t rely solely on user-submitted content or brand
       profiles. Teraffi ingests public data—Wikipedia entries, social media, websites,
       industry trades (IMDb, Deadline, Business of Fashion, SEMA, etc.), quarterly
       earnings reports, and more. This gives us a baseline understanding of the brand
       or IP before they even sign up.
    ○ **User-Submitted Data** : When IP owners (film producers, brand managers, event
       organizers) or brand stakeholders provide additional data (scripts, briefs,
       marketing goals), our Affinity Engine enhances and refines existing knowledge.
2. **Affinity Matching**
    ○ We analyze thematic elements (keywords, brand mission, audience demos,
       brand equity metrics) to identify synergies.
    ○ Weighted scoring ensures that Teraffi highlights the top matches based on
       budget, target audience, brand guidelines, and IP characteristics.
    ○ Teraffi will host proprietary affinity profiles by brand, an industry first
3. **Deal Data & Feedback Loop**


```
○ Every partnership deal on Teraffi is tracked end-to-end.
○ Continuous Improvement : Closed deals (and declined deals) feed back into the
model, revealing which partnerships truly convert. This raises future match rates
and refines the AI further.
```
4. **Integrated Platform**
    ○ Automated pitch-deck creation and standardized data fields for brand
       requirements, project timelines, and creative specs.
    ○ Real-time production schedule updates—no more confusion over shifting dates
       or brand usage restrictions.
Alternative Slide 4:

#### Slide 5: Why Now?

```
● Technological Shift
AI is now powerful enough to handle large-scale ingestion and analysis of unstructured
data—scripts, brand briefs, production schedules, audience insights, and more.
● Creative Automation
What used to be purely human-driven—the concepting of campaigns, pitch decks, and
brand integrations—can now be scaled at lightning speed by AI and LLMs. Teraffi’s
engine synthesizes brand strategy, creative messaging, audience analysis, and
production logistics into instantly actionable ideas.
● Consumer Demand for Authentic Integration
Today’s audiences reject interruptive ads and demand real connections with brands.
Intelligent brand-content matching delivers the organic, deeply resonant experiences
consumers want.
● Economic Pressures
In an environment where every marketing dollar must show impact, Teraffi’s data-driven
approach offers measurable ROI on brand-building—elevating intangible assets into
tangible results.
```

#### Slide 6: Competitive Landscape

```
● CRMs & Ad-Tech : They’re primarily seat-licensed software or ad-focused. They don’t
solve intangible synergy matching, nor do they handle non-standard “partnership” data.
● Manual Agencies : Relationship-driven, slow, no AI-driven scale.
● Teraffi Differentiator :
```
1. **JTBD Pricing** (pay for outcomes, not seats).
2. **Deep Data Ingestion & Matching AI** (including public sources to avoid cold
    starts).
3. **Deal Data Feedback Loop** (continuous model improvements create a moat).

#### Slide 7: Go-To-Market Strategy

1. **Beachhead** : Film/TV producers, digital creators, and brand managers in entertainment
    marketing.
2. **Key Partnerships** : Production houses, streaming platforms, agencies, brand marketing
    consultancies, global brands and agencies.
3. **Expansion** :
    ○ **Sports** (teams, stadiums, leagues, eSports).
    ○ **Social Impact & Nonprofits** (CSR, philanthropic sponsorship).
    ○ **Real Estate** (new developments, naming rights).
    ○ **Government & Political** (issue advocacy, campaign fundraising).
    ○ **Live Events** (music festivals, conferences, expos).

#### Slide 8: Business Model

1. **Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) Pricing** :


```
○ Match Fee : A percentage (e.g. 10%%) of the partnership deal.
○ Activation/Success Fee : Performance-based for launched campaigns or
incremental expansions (cost-per-action or cost-per-result).
○ Data Licensing : Enterprise clients who want Teraffi’s insights can pay
usage-based or subscription-based fees to integrate with internal systems.
```
2. **Moat & Scalability** :
    ○ Low friction: No seat-based licenses.
    ○ Self-reinforcing data network: Each deal enriches Teraffi’s AI, creating
       higher-quality matches and attracting more users.

#### Slide 9: Traction & Case Studies

```
● Media & Entertainment :
○ Show example deals (e.g., 10 film projects matched to 40 brand partners, total
sponsorship of $8M, Teraffi net 10%).
● Real Estate :
○ Pilot partnership connecting luxury real estate developer with brand sponsors to
fund community spaces, naming rights, sustainable brands, motorsport
performance center, and integrated retail experiences. Renaissance at Bader

size, Teraffi’s share, and LTV of recurring brand relationships.
```
#### Slide 12: The Ask

```
● Funding Goal : (e.g., “Raising $5M seed round”).
● Use of Proceeds :
○ Expand engineering to ingest more public data sources, strengthen the Affinity
Engine.
○ Bolster GTM efforts in entertainment, sports, real estate, and social impact.
```
#### Slide 13: Moat & Long-Term Vision

1. **Data Network Effects** : Public data ingestion + user submissions + deal outcomes →
    unstoppable feedback loop.
2. **Ecosystem Standardization** : Teraffi’s data fields and streamlined deal process become
    the industry norm for intangible brand synergy.
3. **Expanding Verticals** : Just like Amazon expanded beyond books, Teraffi moves beyond
    media deals to sports, real estate, philanthropic causes, government campaigns, B2B
    collaborations, and more.
4. **Outcome-Based Differentiation** : JTBD pricing cements Teraffi’s position as the partner
    that only wins when customers win—driving strong loyalty.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR INVESTORS
