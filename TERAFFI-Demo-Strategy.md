# TERAFFI Demo Strategy - Low-Cost MVP for Investor Presentations

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive low-cost demo strategy for TERAFFI that maximizes impact while minimizing development investment. The strategy focuses on creating a compelling "smoke and mirrors" experience that demonstrates the platform's core value proposition through staged data, realistic scenarios, and interactive demos.

**Target Budget**: $15,000 - $25,000 total development cost
**Timeline**: 6-day sprints over 4-6 weeks  
**Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify for instant global access
**Backend**: JSON-based data store with simulated AI responses

## Core Demo Philosophy: "Wizard of Oz" Approach

The demo will feel completely real to investors while using pre-staged data and simulated AI responses. This approach allows us to demonstrate the full user experience and value proposition without building expensive backend infrastructure.

### Key Principles:
1. **Everything Feels Real**: Data, matches, and interactions appear authentic
2. **Maximum Impact**: Focus on "wow" moments that showcase platform power
3. **Minimum Viable Backend**: JSON files and static data with dynamic presentation
4. **Investor-Focused**: Designed specifically for funding presentations and demos
5. **Scalable Foundation**: Architecture supports real backend integration later
